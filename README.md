Tic Tac Toe Overview and How to Play!

When the game begins, it will randomly decide who goes first

You will be given the icon of an X or O

When it is your turn, enter a number from 1-9 corresponding to the board to place your icon

Once you have placed your icon, whatever numbered spot you occupied can no longer be placed on.

Your turn is now over and it is the other player's turn

They will place their different icon using the same grid repeating previous steps

To win, there must be 3 matching icons in a vertical, horizontal, or diagnol line

If all 9 spots of the board are filled with no 3 matching icons in any form of line, the game ends in a draw

The board will clear and the game will reset to randomly choosing who goes first again
