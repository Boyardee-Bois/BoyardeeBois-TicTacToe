# Tic Tac Toe Overview and How to Play!
# When the game begins, it will randomly decide who goes first
# You will be given the icon of an X or O
# When it is your turn, enter a number from 1-9 corresponding to the board to place your icon
# Once you have placed your icon, whatever numbered spot you occupied can no longer be placed on.
# Your turn is now over and it is the other player's turn
# They will place their different icon using the same grid repeating previous steps
# To win, there must be 3 matching icons in a vertical, horizontal, or diagnol line
# If all 9 spots of the board are filled with no 3 matching icons in any form of line, the game ends in a draw
# The board will clear and the game will reset to randomly choosing who goes first again
